Business Case :

It’s cheaper to get current customers to make a repeat purchase than it is to find new customers. And focusing on this will give companies a competitive edge over the others. It is essential for any business to understand its consumers and their requirements and also make an effort to re-engage current customers and get them back. 

Customer Retention: It is the collection of activities and actions a business takes to increase the number of repeat customers and to increase the profitability of each existing customer. The goal of customer retention programs is to help companies retain as many customers as possible and in this process you tend to provide and extract more value from the existing customer base. In short, acquisition creates a foundation of customers while your retention strategy is how you build customer relationships and maximize revenue for each one.

Customer churn - Customer churn is when an existing customer, user, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company.      Ex- A customer deciding to buy his or her groceries in another store.

The key to improve customer retention is to understand the underlying metrics. And so the customers should be studied well, customers response towards the product, service, price, historical data of characteristics of customers, their transactions, the interactions with them  etc can all be taken into consideration to predict the retention potential. As to what kind of customers are of high value and are likely to retain. 

Hence to classify the customers into the 3 divisions namely high/medium/low, we use machine learning algorithms by training the model with the available train data and test the model’s performance on unseen data. Retention Potential predictions will therefore help the retail company devise suitable marketing programs and retention strategies to target specific groups of retail customers as part of continued engagement.
